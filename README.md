This repository contains a Scala code example that demonstrates an uncommon error: NumberFormatException in auxiliary constructors.  The example shows how attempting to convert a String to an Int within an auxiliary constructor can lead to a runtime exception if the String is not a valid integer representation. A solution is provided to address this issue, highlighting the importance of input validation and exception handling.
